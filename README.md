# Bookworm

This is an application that myself and two other team members made during a 2-day hackathon at MakerSquare. The hackathon was done about 4 weeks into the course and was meant to test what we had learned. The application uses Ruby, Sinatra, Foundation, and Google Books API. Users can sign up for the app and select a category of books from which to choose. After that, the app works similar to Tinder in that it randomly generates a book using Google's API for the user to decide whether or not they are "interested" in reading it. If they select "yes," the book is added to their "bookshelf" and another book will appear. Since it was only a 2-day hackathon, we did not have time to implement the algorithm we were working on that would match users with other users that shared similar book preferences, however it was a great learning experience and great practice.
